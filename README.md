# Java Servlet Login Application

Welcome to the **Java Servlet Login Application**! üéâ This project is a straightforward web application designed to demonstrate user authentication using Java Servlets and a MySQL database. With a focus on simplicity and clarity, this application allows users to log in using predefined credentials and displays a personalized welcome message upon successful authentication.

## Features

- **User Login**: Users can log in with a predefined username and password.
- **Error Handling**: Displays informative error messages for incorrect login attempts.
- **Dynamic Response**: Upon successful login, users are redirected to a welcoming page, enhancing the user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Java Servlet API**: For building the server-side logic and handling HTTP requests.
- **MySQL Database**: To manage user credentials and potentially store user sessions.
- **Apache Tomcat Server**: The robust server that hosts our Java Servlets.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating a user-friendly frontend interface.
